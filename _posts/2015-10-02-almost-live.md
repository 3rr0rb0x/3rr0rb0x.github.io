Just setup our new domain. So far so good. It takes some time for things to populate. Next will be the TLS.

For all playing along, it's:

* Github for the host
* Freenom for the domain.
* Cloudflare for the TLS (coming soon)

Remember if you have any questions just you can reach out to me [3rr0rb0x@tuta.io](mailto:3rr0rb0x@tuta.io).
